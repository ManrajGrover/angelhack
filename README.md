# NGO-MAN
Angel Hack Hackathon - This is an app we made during Angel Hack Hackathon held on June 20, 2015 - June 21, 2015.

It is an app made for the low-cost Mozilla firefox OS devices.

Our application revolves around the idea of simplifying various tasks of management and control; an employee of an NGO has to carry out. It helps in keeping a track of donations of various things like food, clothes, money and books.
